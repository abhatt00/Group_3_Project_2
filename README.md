# STARBUCKS MAP

Utilizing D3, JavaScript, Choropleth, Flask, MongoDB, and Python, our group was able to create an interactive map of the United States and display a state-by-state list of chosen economic statistics and a per-state quantity of Starbucks locations. This subject was chosen due to our collective love of coffee, and the shared frequency with which we all visit Starbucks during our respective weeks.


### Built with:
- D3
- JavaScript
- Python
- MongoDB
- HTML
- CSS
- Flask
- Choropleth

### Sources

Starbucks Location: https://www.kaggle.com/
Personal Income Data: https://www.bea.gov/
Labor Force in each State: https://www.bls.gov/


### TO RUN APP

1. In Terminal, navigate to folder with "app.py" file, then run command "python app.py"
2. Once app is running, open a new browser window and go to "http://127.0.0.1:5000/"
3. Click on different states to see listed statistics for store count, Labor force, and Average Personal Income per Capita.
4. For graph and list of states below map, click the name of the state(s) you wish to see plotted when comparing statistics.
5. Findings: California has the largest ratio of average individual income per household compared to known working adults per capita. In addition, California also hosts the most Starbucks locations of the 50 states. However, strictly filtering by Average Personal Income per Capita, Connecticut ranks #1.
